# LELP
Senior Design Code Repository

This repository is for the LeTourneau Lullaby Pacifier (LELP) Senior Design Project.

It is used to update and maintain code for the app and firmware development.

Further information can be obtained in the google drive.


The current status of the development can be found in the commit logs.

Summary of current status:
The GUI has been updated and the functionality has yet to be tested but should work (COVID-19 has created development and testing complications).  It is meant to interface with the Data Stream service created in the firmware for the board.  Further information on the Data Stream can be found in the Electrical subteam folder with information on the packets sent and received.
