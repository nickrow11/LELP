# LELP
Senior Design Code Repository

This repository is for the LeTourneau Lullaby Pacifier (LELP) Senior Design Project.

It will be used to update and maintain code for the app and firmware development.

Ideally iOS will be developed first, with Android to follow.

Firmware is on a different timeline.

Further information can be obtained in the google drive.
